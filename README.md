# Charge-Pump-Project
This project involves the design of a charge pump voltage doubler to efficiently double the input voltage. Key work includes implementing transistor-based designs, addressing timing issues with non-overlapping clocks and level shifters, completing layout design, and validating performance through post-layout simulations.
